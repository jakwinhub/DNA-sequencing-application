This program is intended to represent a DNA sequencing tool. 
The following points should be included in the project.
Possible changes to the project are possible, but will be marked with an edit.

must-support:

* Reading the DNA sequence from a .txt file or manual input
* Validation of the DNA sequence with check for valid nucleotides
* Percentage calculation of the individual nucleotides in the genome
* Motif search: display of specific sequences
* DNA transcription into RNA and then into proteins (specification of protein sequences if desired)


could-support:

* GUI for users to better visualize the functions
* Realization of different input formats (as a model FASTA or GenBank)
* Extended analysis functions, e.g. recognition of the reading frame (ORFs)
* Visualization of DNA sequences with highlighted motifs --> interactive view
* Export options to other file formats, e.g. CSV or PDF


no-support:

* Ongoing connection to a database
* any extended sequence analysis tool
