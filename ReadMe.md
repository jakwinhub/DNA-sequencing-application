This program is intended to represent a DNA sequencing tool. 
The following points should be included in the project.
Possible changes to the project are possible, but will be marked with an edit.

must-support:

1. Reading the DNA sequence from a .txt file or manual input
2. Validation of the DNA sequence with check for valid nucleotides
3. Percentage calculation of the individual nucleotides in the genome
4. Motif search: display of specific sequences
5. DNA transcription into RNA and then into proteins (specification of protein sequences if desired)


could-support:

1. GUI for users to better visualize the functions
2. Realization of different input formats (as a model FASTA or GenBank)
3. Extended analysis functions, e.g. recognition of the reading frame (ORFs)
4. Visualization of DNA sequences with highlighted motifs --> interactive view
5. Export options to other file formats, e.g. CSV or PDF


not-supported:

1. Ongoing connection to a database
2. any extended sequence analysis tool
